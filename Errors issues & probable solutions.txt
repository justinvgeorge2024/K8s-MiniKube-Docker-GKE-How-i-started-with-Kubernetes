*Current system : windows 11 Home | 16 GB ram | i7 12th Gen | nvidia RTX 3060 | Asus M16(2022 edition
additional info : WSL 2 and Oracle vBox were already present before installing docker & minikube.

1)---issue------
minikube start --driver=hyperv does not work properly
------
*diagnosis
--> HyperV is not available by default in Windows 11 Home version ( same for win 10 Home)
#Best Solution
--> use another driver : virtualbox or docker (Recommended) or something else
#workarounds 
--> or setup hyperv in windows (upgrade to pro/enterprise versions...)
--> another workaround (could be sketchy? not sure |Haven't Tried | Wont try in my current system) 
     	--> link : https://www.makeuseof.com/install-hyper-v-windows-11-home/

2)---issue------
minikube start --driver=virtualbox throwing errors like VT-X/AT-X and other problems
------
--> presence of WSL 2 induces some virualization problems and conflicts
--> as per web-sources Disabling WSL2 should work.
*persisting problem | unsolved
--> For my system, minikube starts and shows up in virtualbox but system crashes(self restart| your pc ran into a problem) or powershell freezes.
*probable reason - virtualisation issues
	--> Using windows home which does not support Hyperv directly 
#workaround | not found

3)---issue------
Exiting due to GUEST_START: failed to start node: Failed kubeconfig update: decode kubeconfig from " ~\\.kube\\config": decode data: : yaml: control characters are not allowed
------ 
*diagnosis
--> the cofig file in ~C:\users\~\.kube\ directory contains invalid characters
--> my entire config file was corrupted
--> showed up randomly on 3rd day using minikube (everthing was fine till the day before)
*probable reasons
--> some problem (incorrect configuration/system issue) might have occurred while running >minikube start ...
# Best solution
--> delete the config file (common directory path: C:\users\<user>\.kube\) [might have to enable hidden files]
   --> then re-run the >minikube start ... command
*it will automatically create a new (compatible) config file
#workaround
--> if problem still persists.. run> minikube delete (delete the problematic profiles [or all profiles (*_0) ])
--> then delete the config file and retry the >minikube start

4)---issue----
kubectl powershell auto completion not working
*diagnosis
-->might need to enable scripts in powershell
#solution
run in PS: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
then press Y
then run: kubectl completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
then run: kubectl completion powershell >> $PROFILE
then restart PS

5)-----issue------
[API's with authentication]
commands like: > export TOKEN=$(kubectl create token default)
*dosen't work in windows powershell/cmd
#solution
Run the command(s) in Git Bash


6)---issue----
--> pod not READY
refer trial_6 > pods
* a sample problem case and solution is displayed
# if the replace option is not working/ throwing errors
* use --force to force the change

7)------issue------
> kubectl.exe get rs frontend --replicas=4
error: unknown flag: --replicas
#diagnosis
--replicas is not supported with get
--> use with scale / exopse
*supported command
> kubectl scale rs frontend --replicas=4

8)------issue--------
--> when running:
  >kubectl create namespace <namespace_name>
*Unable to connect to the server: <---> connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
*occurred aftter restarting the computer
#diagnosis & solution
-> check if Minikube (or alternatives) is up and running
-> check if docker(or alternatives) is running properly
* command worked for me after running minikube start.

9)--------issue-----
openssl , powershell , windows 11 Home problem
*description
running command >openssl req -new -key bob.key -out bob.csr -subj '/CN=bob/O=learner'

10)-----issue-----
Windows 11 | powershell issue | base64 conversion .csr file
*issue
> cat bob.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n','%'
base64 : The term 'base64' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:15
+ cat bob.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n','%'
+               ~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (base64:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

*diagnosis
--> no 'cat' in windows PS
--> equivalent is type
--> the above command first converts to base64 and then removes \n, % 
--> to get desired output -- do following commands in PS :
#solution / windows PS workround
run >certutil -encode bob.csr bob_base64.txt
run >type bob_base64.txt | find /v "%" | find /v "^$" > bob_base64_clean.txt
*more issues
the second command might throw errors or might not work in some cases
--> in such a case 
	--> open bob_base64.txt -obtained after 1st command
	--> then manually remove the newlines from the file and use it
#more proper solution
--> use GIT BASH or WSL
