*Current system : windows 11 Home | 16 GB ram | i7 12th Gen | nvidia RTX 3060 | Asus M16(2022 edition
additional info : WSL 2 and Oracle vBox were already present before installing docker & minikube.

---issue------
minikube start --driver=hyperv does not work properly
------
*diagnosis
--> HyperV is not available by default in Windows 11 Home version ( same for win 10 Home)
#Best Solution
--> use another driver : virtualbox or docker (Recommended) or something else
#workarounds 
--> or setup hyperv in windows (upgrade to pro/enterprise versions...)
--> another workaround (could be sketchy? not sure |Haven't Tried | Wont try in my current system) 
     	--> link : https://www.makeuseof.com/install-hyper-v-windows-11-home/

---issue------
minikube start --driver=virtualbox throwing errors like VT-X/AT-X and other problems
------
--> presence of WSL 2 induces some virualization problems and conflicts
--> as per web-sources Disabling WSL2 should work.
*persisting problem | unsolved
--> For my system, minikube starts and shows up in virtualbox but system crashes(self restart| your pc ran into a problem) or powershell freezes.
*probable reason - virtualisation issues
	--> Using windows home which does not support Hyperv directly 
#workaround | not found

---issue------
Exiting due to GUEST_START: failed to start node: Failed kubeconfig update: decode kubeconfig from " ~\\.kube\\config": decode data: : yaml: control characters are not allowed
------ 
*diagnosis
--> the cofig file in ~C:\users\~\.kube\ directory contains invalid characters
--> my entire config file was corrupted
--> showed up randomly on 3rd day using minikube (everthing was fine till the day before)
*probable reasons
--> some problem (incorrect configuration/system issue) might have occurred while running >minikube start ...
# Best solution
--> delete the config file (common directory path: C:\users\<user>\.kube\) [might have to enable hidden files]
   --> then re-run the >minikube start ... command
*it will automatically create a new (compatible) config file
#workaround
--> if problem still persists.. run> minikube delete (delete the problematic profiles [or all profiles (*_0) ])
--> then delete the config file and retry the >minikube start
