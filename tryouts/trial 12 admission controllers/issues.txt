will not recommend doing this in windows--
even with wsl / git bash or other terminals

--> do in Linux os

--> too many issues

once minikube ssh is done-->
the terminal dimensions are set
$COLUMNS is set to 80

did not find any working solutions for the same
will have to adjust to it

--> the ssh terminal is buggy
--> by default will have to use vi
but after using the vi.. the cli interface is buggy , none of the default commands work properly.

arrow keys dont work , esc , delete, backspace dont work.
hjkl works sometimes.
after pressing i , it is stuck on insert mode.

--> did sudo apt install vim
--> opened through vim
--> arrow keys still dont work.
--> fortunately hjkl works
--> esc didnt work when in insert mode... but ctrl+c does the job.
--> workaround not recommended.

use Linux/Ubuntu for better user experience
